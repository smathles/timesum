- Furmanite work out at the Ampol refinery.

If there's a leak in the high-pressure line, they come in and do "hot work". They design a clamp, they come in, slide it over the failure.
- They slide over the pipe, nipple on them to inject a 


We have AS1210. The US has ASME12. They show us all their calculations.

Some point soon, I need to log some CPD against understanding ASME. I need to be able to follow their calculations.

2850 or 3250, can't remember. Joe usually does this with a solid FEA model. Check their calcs for stoopid errors. issue cert.
- Review the paper trail. Cursory review, use the exact cert Joe's used in the past.
- It's up to them that their safety procedures are functional.

We need to be able to use ASME as well as AS 1210. The contractors will use ASME

Other thing: TEM1159. Root folder, clamps, add folder, "CL-1689" or something. All the data, including certs, goes here.


All I need to do for this job.
- Write a cert for that procedure (see example things in job folder)
- change out the procedure filenames in the issued cert
- Amend the cert they sent us to reference that cert we were sent.

We charge them $800. Go into the Xero, check what exact dollar value we use.

- Basically reviewed AS 1210
- Also looked a bit at 2nd moment of area calcs.

- ASME: It's Sec VIII that I need to know. Part 1 really.

Spend some time in ASME. Learn how this all works, learn how to do the stuff.
- "If you want to have a vessel shell, you do the calculation this way"
- Really get your teeth into what they define as a pressure vessel and different applications of pressure vessels.
    - Internal pressure, different head shapes (conical, spherical heads, etc)
- A job is coming up. Flat vessels and tube. Picture a radiator, rectangular heads at either end, with tube plates.
    - Get a hand of how pressure vessels for heat exchangers vs. spherical/cylindrical vessels.

Also read A 1210

Need datasheets or info on all this piping stuff.
- Valves? Connectors? What components are these, and do we have datasheets for them?
- diverter plates, not baffle plates.
- Luke to hugh, to rob, to me, we worked out there's diverter plates to go in here.
- We can look at material thickness, need to get 

- Didn't get onto old mate. Do this again tomorrow.

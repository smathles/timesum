    - area of the outputs is bigger than the area of the chamber. So you're not going to get a blockage.
    - going to need: Inertia problem (I = Fd)
    - go back to Johnathan?
        - "Is there a requirement to have two outlets?"
            - confirm area of outputs vs. the pipe diameter.
            - Do we know the flow rate of the pipe? Pressure doesn't really tell us enough.
            - If not. We just design it to 5000 PSI.
    - Consider this as water. Do a bit of research.
    - Get in contact with Joe. Rob would like his input on the direction to proceed with this.
        - from out front, this looks very simple. But having evidence to back this is the tricky part.
        - Can we physically test this?
        - Or can Joe have another view?
            - pressure vessel, energy equation, what pressure in there, what flow rates, what flow rate through openings, "openings are bigger than pipe input, all good.", how fast is the water coming out?
            - We to verify that we're not building a pressure chamber in here. We then want to do a different method (force based on deflection).
            - "Rob asks because he respects his authority and appreciates the knowledge you can bring to this problem".

drum. Which drum?

- rope guide pileup sensor. We would like to see this.

- Start with the structural. 

- At this stage, we believe we have enough information to start. Invariably, we'll get more details.

- I'm involved in other projects this month,

- I really don't know what's acceptable to put on a cert. 1428.1-2009 is my best bet. How long? Idk. Why? Idk. These are all matters of personal judgement, there are no standards or product data that I can find at all.
- 


We're still investigating the "gas buster" thing. We're running some numbers to quantify flow conditions.

Do you have a flow rate? Or rate per hour? 


# TODO:
- Review BHL1890 data with Rob
    - Looks good, but incomplete. Really I also need Isometrics with labels, so I know what goes where. This is very hard to judge in incomplete chinese drawings.
    - Need confirmation that the barrels have "cable-no-jumpy-out-please" protection.

- Finish louvre analysis/design/etc.
    - Finish certificate, review with Rob.
    - Hugh left... lol.

- Mud Showerhead: ongoing saga
    - Review communication with Rob.

- Hiab Crane:
    - Risk assessment, review with Rob?
    - Follow up old mate, but give him another days.

- Talk to Hugh.
    - could go out to holmwood highgate to measure some stands.

- Training: Could continue on with the ASME stuff.

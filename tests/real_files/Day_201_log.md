- Start risk assessment form.

    HIAB crane, some stuff to change.

    step 1: get old mate to provide the data from the computer.
    if it's done like 3 hours work in its life, maybe we don't do full NDT.
    Please replace the rubber hoses/oils/etc.
    - Don't inspect/repair lol.


    Standard says: Do it this way. Then it says: "A competent person may judge a different level of inspection"
    - Rob is looking for a per-component table:
        - Does it undergo full NDT/inspection/repair/replace?
        - Column 1: Visual inspection/NDT inspection
        - Risk assessment: What is the risk of failure? Loss of life, monetary loss, inconvenience, etc.
            - AS 4024/1503, methodologies for risk assessment. Check this, likilhood of consequence.
            - end up with a risk assessment for each item, along with a justification.
                - Risk assessment as-is.
                - Risk assessment as-new.
        - ...leads into comments section.
    Get some pictures of this thing. where does the load go through? Look back at your test plan, check if parts are actually relevant to the load path.
    - Jib boom components, Jib arm. Not "middle boom, end boom, left boom, pin 64, pin 79"

    Hook, boom sections, turret section, vehicle mounting frame component. Do a bit of research online, 

    What Rob is looking for is kinda open-ended. You don't need to have a hardcore "exact" layout. But you do need to provide documentation showing that you thought about this for the nice barristers and judges.

hydraulic retardation brakes -- Research this.
- Rob would typically 


Seems reasonable and practicable to get a motor with a brake.

Based on a reasonable interpretation of the standard, this will need a braking element.

Happy to reconsider if you can provide a positive example of one.

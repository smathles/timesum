OK. We just don't have enough info to proceed.

- Rob wants to confirm if we can X-REF stuff. We can't. (ok, sometimes we can. Other times, no)

- "Give information", "Rc'd information"
- Make a record

- The thing needs a plate on the end that this can bang into.
- What Rob reckons it needs is (because it's gaseous liquid) a chimney/stack. While this is not going to be a formalised gas buster, there is still a non-zero possibility of this building up with flammable gas.
- How tall do we make this chimney? We don't want this filling up with water.
    - If they say "nah, there's no way this can happen", all good. We're not actually. 
    - suggestion is that this head can be bolted on/off.

- minimum required thickness for that end.
- square allowance
- Rob reckons it should have some sort of vertical stack
- The question becomes "how tall do you make this thing"
    - go up and do a U-turn?
    - make it taller?

First what thickness does the end need to be?
- What thickness does the pipe need to be?

### 16:38-17:16
- end thickness is retardedly thick. Talk to rob regarding assumptions.

# TODO:
## Waiting for Rob:
- Review BHL1890 data with Rob
    - Looks good, but incomplete. Really I also need Isometrics with labels, so I know what goes where. This is very hard to judge in incomplete chinese drawings.

- Finish louvre analysis/design/etc.
    - Finish certificate, review with Rob.

## Could continue now... Maybe.

- Gas buster: ongoing saga
    - Review communication with Rob.

- Hiab Crane:
    - Risk assessment, review with Rob?
    - Follow up old mate, but give him another days.

- Talk to Hugh.
    - could go out to holmwood highgate to measure some stands.

- Training: Could continue on with the ASME stuff.

Need datasheets or info on all this piping stuff.
- Valves? Connectors? What components are these, and do we have datasheets for them?
- diverter plates, not baffle plates.
- Luke to hugh, to rob, to me, we worked out there's diverter plates to go in here.
- We can look at material thickness for these baffles, need to get 

Pressure release valve is 15000 PSI, system only goes to 5000 PSI.


Gas buster, they've never built one.
- Don't know what thickness plates. Don't know plate arrangement. Don't know what diameter pipe.
- Pipe 
- all valves are the standard PI

SMI valves. What is SMI anyway?

- Know the operating pressure. Design the pipework to be compliant to 5000 PSI.

Providing that our opening is as large by some litte factor (re-entrant losses, etc). Outflow is not limiting factor, it's going to be pipework.

Diverter plates. Do they want them? What 


If he wants a plate for the mud to get sprayed onto, that's cool. But do you want one flat disk on the end? What functionality do you need?

- If you tell us exactly what you want, we can certify (or not certify) that.
    - Do you want a pressure test?
    - Do you want the mud to be pummeled against a plate?

We can:
- Certify mechanical strength of plates given positions
- Certify piping is rated appropriately and will not burst

We cannot:
- Certify "enough gas is removed" or "gas buster works well enough".
- Advise where to put plates to remove maximum gas.
    - I can guess. But so can anyone. We can't formally certify this.

#### Johnathan:
- His perspective was still "this is a gas buster"
- He has to get in contact with Luke, there's a miscommunication there.
- Yeeeaaaah, technically there's a bit of gas busting, but no.

- Luke understands there will be no progress.

- Continue with risk assessment

{
    HIAB crane, some stuff to change.

    Please replace the rubber hoses/oils/etc.
    - Don't inspect/repair lol.

    Standard says: Do it this way. Then it says: "A competent person may judge a different level of inspection"
    - Rob is looking for a per-component table:
        - Does it undergo full NDT/inspection/repair/replace?
        - Column 1: Visual inspection/NDT inspection
        - Risk assessment: What is the risk of failure? Loss of life, monetary loss, inconvenience, etc.
            - AS 4024/1503, methodologies for risk assessment. Check this, likilhood of consequence.
            - end up with a risk assessment for each item, along with a justification.
                - Risk assessment as-is.
                - Risk assessment as-new.
        - ...leads into comments section.
    Get some pictures of this thing. where does the load go through? Look back at your test plan, check if parts are actually relevant to the load path.
    - Jib boom components, Jib arm. Not "middle boom, end boom, left boom, pin 64, pin 79"

    Hook, boom sections, turret section, vehicle mounting frame component. Do a bit of research online, 

    What Rob is looking for is kinda open-ended. You don't need to have a hardcore "exact" layout. But you do need to provide documentation showing that you thought about this for the nice barristers and judges.

- Scope job

- This does NOT work like "grab handle at the bottom, do this". This works like "grap louvre, any louvre, and tilt it up/down"
- So it would be nice to certify this for the full length, then offer short versions.

- Literally just copy what's there. Do test 10kg loadings (like Hugh mentioned), do test tensile/buckling calcs.

# TODO:
- Gas buster: ongoing saga
    - prefer I can contribute to this work

- Hiab Crane:
    - Risk assessment, review

- Talk to Hugh.
    - could go out to holmwood highgate to measure some stands.
        - Tomorrow.

- Training: Could continue on with the ASME stuff.

- Investigate new supplied data. I think it's not going to be enough. Review with Rob.

Gas buster:
- email says "I have teken my toughts from some pictures of a horizontal style"
    - I can't verify what this thing even is in the picture.
    - Is it a gas buster? Maybe.
- Oztac shows a different version they built years ago which they're trying to avoid. Looks better (actual gas separation)
- In my opinion, their current version will not even work, let alone fulfil standards.
    - No baffle plates/falling system to separate gas
    - No vacuum system to separate gas
    - Gas vent will let mud out, not gas.
    - End chamber does not have a gas outlet separated: --> just opens up.
        (how is that different from just pouring out the mud?)
    - Gas vent almost level with container: Almost certainly not allowed.


What I need to get done:
- "This is what I think needs to happen"
- Get the pathway of practically what this thing needs to look like.
- Get the pathway for Rob, so he can review all this and make his mind up on how to do this.

- Go back to Johnathan now and say: "Hey johnathan, looking at the gas buster system (blame it on the STEP file), looking at the file, it's just an empty tube, there's no mechanism for gas separation, (looks like this will not be effective to separate mud)"
- We are now reviewing the relevant API standards for gas buster systems to determine how these things need to be built.
    - How effective is a vertical thing anyway? 10%? 99%? No idea.
    - What about a horizontal one?
- Don't use language that indicates you don't know what you're doing!
- We will continue to review the relevant API.

## R&D??????
### 10:23-12:31

# TODO:
<!-- 1. Send OZT2122 stuff to Rob -->
<!--     - link to docs, link to sheet, link to useful YT videos and stuff. -->
2. email/call Chad
    - "here's the inspection test plan"
    - When you see the inspection plan, he'll panic and go "ayoooooo, what's this, this is too long"
    - We have to justify *why* we don't need to do this.
    - Step 1: Get the usage data out of the crane, send it to us. We will send a second revision and get this trimmed down.
        - Give chad a call. Send him an email.

    invoice in drafts for him. Please issue this, click send. Send the invoice from Xero, send him an email and a call please.

    "very sorry this has taken a bit longer, people were away, starting up for the year. tbh it was mostly done last year anyway"
2. Check documents for BHL1890 with Rob
3. Joe
        - Changes to VFD housing stuff.
4. Update + process ITP for dean farms.

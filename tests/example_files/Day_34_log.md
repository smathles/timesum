- I need to start to systemise my assumptions and log files.
- So use 24 hour time from now on. Assume if there's a "11 to 1" timeframe, this is 11am day one to 1am day two.
    - Not "human interpretation", but a computer is a dumb machine.
    - Should be "11 to 13".
    - Limit this to a 24 hour window. 11-1 will never mean 11am day one to 1am day {3,4,5,etc}.
